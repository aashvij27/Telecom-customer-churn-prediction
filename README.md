Telecom-customer-churn-prediction model

Project Overview
Customer churn â€” the loss of existing customers to competitors â€” is one of the most significant challenges in the telecom industry. This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing historical usage patterns, demographic details, and service interactions. By identifying at-risk customers in advance, telecom providers can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce revenue loss and improve customer satisfaction.

The project leverages machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, combined with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key churn-driving factors.
